When I was a physics student in my undergraduate studies, I learnt a lot of terms that look like "XXXian", "XXX space". For example, "Newtonian", "Lagrangian", "Hamiltonian", and "Hilbert space". Of course, after those years, I can barely remember what they actually mean. Anyway, I would like to name this website "Colemanian space", with the sense that it acts as a site/repository (So, "Space") consisting of my works/ideas (So, "Colemanian") towards the prosperity of humankind.
I recall that one of my kendo senpai (He is a math guy) also named his website "Vernonian space". I believe for most of us, regardless of our occupation or educational level, would like to share our experiences with others so that they can learn from them.
Just as in the past, when we were still living in the tree branches, we would notice our kind or friends of other species where the fruits were and whether the enemy was coming or not.
